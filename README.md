# RunManifest Generator for Element AVITI‚Ñ¢ Sequencing

This is a simple and flexible Streamlit web application for generating a valid `RunManifest.csv` file used in the Element AVITI‚Ñ¢ System. It is specifically designed for our lab that frequently run pooled sequencing experiments with diverse library types(e.g. 10X scATAC-seq & scRNA-seq, HTO & ADT from CITE-seq)  and configurations.

## üîç What is a RunManifest?

A `RunManifest.csv` file is required by the **Element AVITI‚Ñ¢ System** and the **Bases2Fastq** software to:

- Configure sequencing runs
- Specify adapter trimming, masking, and demultiplexing parameters
- Convert bases files into demultiplexed FASTQ files based on index sequences

## üö® Why this tool?

In our lab, we frequently sequence **customized pooled libraries** across different lanes and sample types (e.g. RNA, ATAC, HTO, ADT). The structure of each library ‚Äî including adapter lengths, index lengths, UMI presence, and lane assignments ‚Äî often differs between runs.

Creating the RunManifest manually every time is **error-prone** and **time-consuming**, especially when:

- Pooling multiple libraries with unique index combinations
- Distinguishing between 8-mer and 10-mer index sequences (e.g. ATAC index1 requires `AT` appended to 8-mers)
- Adjusting `UMIMask`, `FastQMask`, or lane-specific settings based on library type

This tool automatically handles all of the above and generates a valid `RunManifest.csv` in one click.
